# joint-military-symbology-xml
Joint Military Symbology XML (JointMilSyML or JMSML) is an XML schema, and associated instance data, designed to definitively document the contents of US DOD MIL-STD-2525D and NATO APP-6(D).

The purpose of defining this schema and populating its associated instance data is four-fold:
  * To aid in the configuration management (CM) of these standards.
  * To provide implementors with a machine-readable form of the contents of these standards.
  * To help support legacy military symbology systems by providing bi-directional lookup of SIDCs.
  * To aid in migrating old military symbology information to the latest version of these standards.

In providing this schema, files of instance data, and sample C# code to navigate same, it is hoped that future defense and intelligence systems will be engineered to take advantage of this technology and, in so doing, accelerate the delivery of new military symbology, reflected in updates to these standards, to warfighters.

### Releasability
* APP-6:
  * APP-6(D): Unmarked, denoting that it is approved for public release and unlimited distribution.
  * Previous Versions: As of promulgation of APP-6(D)(1), the classification markings on all previous editions are invalid and no longer applicable.
* MIL-STD-2525: Approved for public release, distribution is unlimited.

## Features

* Schema (xsd) files for:
  * Commonly used types.
  * The base portion (part one) of a military symbol ID code (SIDC).
  * The symbol set portion (part two) of a military symbol ID code (SIDC).

* Instance (xml) files for:
  * The base portion of the two standards.
  * Each symbol set, including all legacy symbols from 2525C and Bc2, for all relevant appendices/chapters.

* SVG files for all of the frames, entities, modifiers, and other graphic amplifiers needed to implement military symbology.

* A .Net (C#) solution that contains projects with all the code to:
  * Define all the classes needed to import the XML instance data.
  * Navigate the aforementioned classes to perform the following functions:
    * Convert from old style 15-character SIDC to new style 20-digit SIDC.
    * Convert from new style 20-digit SIDC to old style 15-character SIDC.
  * Test the above functions.

## Instructions

### General Help
[New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

### Getting Started with the solution
* If you intend to use the SVG files with the image conversion utilities found under the Utilities source folder, please consult its instructions [here](./source/utilities/image-conversion-utilities/README.md).
* Open and build the Visual Studio Solution at joint-military-symbology-xml\source\JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS
    * To use MSBuild to build the solution
        * Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS 2012
        * `cd joint-military-symbology-xml\source\JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS`
        * `msbuild JointMilitarySymbologyLibrary.sln /property:Configuration=Release`
            * NOTE: if you recieve an error message: `'msbuild' is not recognized` 
            * You may need to add the path to the .NET Framework SDK (if multiple SDKs are installed)
            * E.g. `set path=%path%;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319`
* Use the UnitTests project and the Visual Studio Test tools to run the unit tests provided.  These will test various aspects of the source used to navigate the XML data and convert symbol ID codes (SIDC) from one military symbology standard to another.
* To run the unit tests from a command line:
	* Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt: Start Menu | Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 | Visual Studio Tools | Developer Command Prompt for VS 2012
        * `cd joint-military-symbology-xml\source\JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS`
        * `MSTest /testmetadata:JointMilitarySymbologyLibrary.vsmdi /testlist:"JMSML Tests"`
* Run the Test project to see a form appear, which you can use to manually test the SIDC conversion.
	* Select from either of the two lists of symbols (2525C or 2525D) and the application will use the underlying C# library to convert the selected symbol ID code (SIDC) from one standard to the other.
	* Note that not all possible 2525D codes will convert to 2525C codes, or vice versa.  
		* Because of the component construction nature of 2525D, there are many more symbol ID combinations possible in 2525D, combinations that don't convert to 2525C.
* DISA provides graphic files (svg) for the individual parts of MIL-STD 2525 (included herein).  The JMSML schema supports referencing those files and the included C# library contains functionality that can be used to combine those referenced files into a complete image.
* If you wish to use the Joint Military Symbology XML Demo from the screenshot above, build and run the Test Folder located here (https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/tree/master/source/JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS/Test).

## NLog

Visit http://nlog-project.org/ for more information.

## Svg

Svg is a GitHub repo located here: [https://github.com/vvvv/SVG](https://github.com/vvvv/SVG)

It provides the JMSML Demo application/project with the capability to display the svg files included in this repo.

The Svg Rendering Engine is licensed under the [Microsoft Public License](https://svg.codeplex.com/license).

To configure JMSML to use the included svgs, edit the `jmsml.config` file found here: [jmsml.config](/source/JointMilitarySymbologyLibraryCS/jmsml.config) with a value for `GraphicHome` that points to your folder containing the svg files.  Then clean and rebuild the JMSML solution.

In `jmsml.config`, The `SVGHome` attribute should point to the location of the actual 2525 svg files.  The `GraphicRoot` attribute is the string prefixed to paths in the image, name, category, tag export files. The `GraphicHome` attribute should point to the real disk location of your `GraphicRoot`. The `GraphicExtension` attribute should be the three letter file name extension for the image files you have stored in your `GraphicHome`.  These may be the original svg files or, perhaps, they are emf files if you have converted the svgs.

This repo's documentation includes HTML pages generated with a pair of third party tools, re-distributed here in the Documentation folder's Utilities sub-folder.

The tools include xs3p, which is a schema documentation generator in the form of an XSLT.  xs3p was developed by Australia's Distributed Systems Technology Centre (DSTC), a Cooperative Research Center, which folded in 2006.  The DSTC started and hosted the Australian W3C Office.  Since its abandonment, xs3p has been hosted by FiForms Solutions on SourceForge.

More information about xs3p can be found [here](http://xml.fiforms.org/xs3p/).  The DSTC Public License information can be found included [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/joint-military-symbology-xml/documentation/utilities/LICENSE.html), and was used by the DSTC to make its work available to software developers.

These utilities also include a batch file and JS script that exercise MSXML6 as a command line utility.  More information can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/xml-transformation-tool/).  With its license information found [here](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

## Versioning

JMSML models an XML representation of the contents of MIL-STD-2525D.  One of the stated goals for JMSML is to facilitate the delivery of approved, and subsequently implemented, Change Proposals (CPs) to fielded systems.

JMSML versioning facilitates the tracking of CP implementation between major published releases of 2525D.

__JMSML Versioning__

JMSML Version | Notes
---|---
1.0.0 | 2525D, as published
1.0.1 | May include approved and implemented Change 1 CPs
1.0.2 | May include more approved and implemented Change 1 CPs
'' | ''
1.1.0 | 2525D Change 1, as published
'' | ''

__2525D Versioning__

2525D Version | Notes
---|---
2525D-0 | 2525D, as published
2525D-1 | 2525D Change 1, as published

Each JMSML version will also include bug fixes and other enhancements or content improvements deemed necessary to better meet our goal of providing military symbology implementers with a quality resource.  

Implemented change proposals (CPs) and other major enhancements will be identified/listed in each version's release notes.

## Issues

Several parts of the provided schema have been defined (DrawingRules, LabelRules, Geometries, etc.) but are otherwise empty of full instance data.  Work continues on this project, as it evolves to provide more content for use by implementers, and some of that work will fill in the aforementioned missing data.
